RotatePad
=========

RotatePad is an unofficial extension for GEFS-Online
(http://www.gefs-online.com), the free flight simulator based on the Google
Earth Plugin.  Though GEFS provides some functionality to use your joystick,
it is unfortunately broken and doesn't work in most browsers.

This extension allows users of Chrome, Firefox and Opera 15+ to use the native
browser functionality as controls for GEFS.  Support for Internet Explorer and
Safari is a work in progress due to a lack of native support on the platform.

We recommend using Google Earth Plugin v6.2.2.6613, as later versions use a
new terrain data model which makes GEFS unusuable.
